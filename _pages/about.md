I am currenty a postdoctoral researcher investigating inverse problems in low-field MRI at the Department of Mathmematical Sciences at the University of Oulu.

My research interests include: inverse problems, medical imaging, physical modelling, and optimization.

I began my academic path by studying physics and mathematics, and began to move towards applied mathematics and inverse problems during my master's studies. Now, I am most interested in applying mathematics and physics theory for problems in medical imaging, and in particular the image reconstruction problems that arise in the various imaging modalities, such as ultrasound tomography (UST) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
