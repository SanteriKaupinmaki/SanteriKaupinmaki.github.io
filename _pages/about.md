I am currenty a postdoctoral researcher investigating inverse problems in low-field MRI at the Department of Mathmematical Sciences at the University of Oulu.

My research interests include: medical imaging, inverse problems, physical modelling, and optimization.

I have previously researched topology optimization for optimal ultrasound reflector design, ultrasound tomography using phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive sensors, and cloud type classification based on radiation and cloud height data. 
Before pursuing my PhD in Medical Imaging at University College London I received an MSc in Theoretical Physics at University of Helsinki, and before that I completed my BSc in Mathematical Physics at University of Waterloo.
Currently my primary interest is in the field of medical imaging, and in particular researching the inverse problem present in the various imaging modalities that are used clinically, or have been proposed for future use.
