I am currenty a postdoctoral researcher in inverse problems for low-field MRI at the Department of Mathmematical Sciences at the University of Oulu.

I have previously researched topology optimization for optimal ultrasound reflector design, ultrasound tomography using phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive sensors, and cloud type classification based on radiation and cloud height data. 
Before pursuing my PhD in medical imaging, I studied theoretical physics with particular focus on quantum mechanics, writing my master's thesis on the spin-boson open quantum system.
